                            <h1>ABOUT SENSHI</h1>

                            <p style="color: #d3d3d3;">In the small village Kisuki, located in the Oita prefecture, a
                                boy is born to a father who died before his birth and a mother who died giving birth to
                                him. A village built around a defensive castle and dotted with hills across its breadth,
                                Kitsuki is anything but welcoming. The nameless child is raised by the village until he
                                learns to walk on his own two legs and speak with his tongue. The child learns from the
                                good and the bad people in the village but there is nobody in the village who loves him
                                unconditionally.</p>

                            <p style="color: #d3d3d3;">As a boy, the child faces opposition and bullying from all the
                                other boys around him. The village refuses to acknowledge his oppression and
                                defenceless, the boy finds himself learning to fend for himself. He takes under the
                                tutelage of the only samurai in the village, who does not show him extraordinary
                                compassion but also does not think of him any different from others in the village. The
                                boy learns to fight, not for himself but, for the greater good of his village and
                                society. Thus is born ‘SENSHI’ the warrior that his master foretells to be the saviour
                                and messiah of the village.</p>

                            <p style="color: #d3d3d3;">Just five years after he begins learning from his master,
                                ‘SENSHI’ earns the title of Samurai and cements his name in the rich tradition of the
                                way of the Japanese warrior. His master, knowing that he has completed his
                                responsibility towards his village, passes away and grief is observed for three days.
                                Much abuse and suspicion is hurled at ‘SENSHI’ declaring him to be the murderer of his
                                master but he manages to prove his innocence and the village goes back to rejecting his
                                existence.</p>

                            <p style="color: #d3d3d3;">When the neighbouring town of Akita and their Samurais hear of
                                this incident, they choose to seize their moment. A rivalry between the two villages had
                                been sown centuries ago until the Samurais had decided they had had enough of the
                                fighting. However, with the death of their only Samurai, the village of Kitsuki would be
                                left weak and theirs for the taking.</p>

                            <p style="color: #d3d3d3;">The Samurais and warriors of Akita prepare themselves for war,
                                all while Kitsuki is completely unaware. In the middle of a full moon night, the
                                warriors cross the river between the two villages and reach the adjacent river bank.
                                There they find a tall and intimidating figure, resembling a Samurai, that appears to be
                                waiting for them. The figure, none other than Senshi, draws his katana from its sheath
                                and the warriors charge towards him.</p>

                            <p style="color: #d3d3d3;">A gang of twenty samurais, drenched in heavily plated armour run
                                towards Senshi with their naked swords. Senshi slashes through each of their swords with
                                his katana like a knife through butter until only his sword remains. The Samurais are
                                stunned and powerless without their swords. They begin to bow, one by one, in front of
                                Senshi to show their respect and admiration. From behind them, their leader appears
                                arrogantly with an aim to kill Senshi. Senshi requires only one slash of his katana to
                                slice through him and the battle ends. He restores peace to the villages and becomes a
                                legend forever written in the annals of history.</p>
